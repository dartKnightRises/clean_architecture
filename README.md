# clean_architecture

A new Flutter project for understanding clean architecture.

## Explaination

This code is a basic example of a singleton implementation in Flutter using a `StatefulWidget`. Let's break it down:

1. **Import Statement**: This line imports the material package from Flutter, which contains widgets and classes for building UIs.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. **`MyApp` Class**: This class represents the main application. It extends `StatefulWidget`, indicating that its state can change during the lifetime of the widget.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget 
```

3. **Private Named Constructor**: `_internal` is a private named constructor, meaning it can only be accessed from within the class or its subclasses.

```dart
  MyApp._internal() // private named constructor
```

4. **Static Singleton Instance**: `instance` is a static final variable of type `MyApp`, which holds a single instance of the `MyApp` class. This follows the Singleton design pattern, ensuring only one instance of `MyApp` exists throughout the application.

```dart
  static final MyApp instance = MyApp._internal();
```

5. **Factory Constructor**: The `factory` constructor allows for custom instantiation logic. In this case, it returns the `instance` variable, ensuring that whenever someone tries to create a new `MyApp` object, they get the same instance.

```dart
  factory MyApp() => instance;
```

6. **`_MyAppState` Class**: This class represents the state of the `MyApp` widget. It extends `State<MyApp>`.

```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> 
```

7. **`build` Method**: This method is required to build the UI of the widget. In this example, it returns a simple `Container`. You would typically replace this with your actual UI components.

```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }

```

Overall, this code sets up a `MyApp` class with a Singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of `MyApp` exists throughout the application's lifecycle.
